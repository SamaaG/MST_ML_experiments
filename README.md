# Information about supplementary material

In this repository, we include the data, code, and models that we used in our evaluations and experiments. Specifically, they are divided into the following:

## Preprocessing code to generate thresholds
This part is what we use to generate the space of f-1 and bandwidth utilization numbers for different configurations of lower and upper thresholds. These results are used to generate the heatmaps in Figure XX. This code is placed in the files XXX and YYY in this repository. 

## optimization functions
This part is what we use to run the optimization functions that we describe in Section XX. This code is used in the experiments in Figure XX. This code is placed in the files XXX and YYY in this repository.

## Croesus edge-cloud implementation
This part is the implementation of our Croesus prototype. This includes an implementation of a client, edge, and cloud nodes. The client generates requests and sends frames to be processed, the edge processes requests, transactions, and coordinate with the cloud for cloud labels, and the cloud node runs the cloud CNN model. This part is used for experiments shown in Figures XX and YY. The files for these implementations are in XXX and YYYY in this repository.

## CNN Model processing and detection functions
This part handles the functions that related to processing CNN models as well as other image processing functions such computing overlapping bounding boxes. This part is used in the experiments shown in Figures XXX and YYY. The files for these implementations are XXX and YYY in this repository.
